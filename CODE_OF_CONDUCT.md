# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Spamming, flooding, or deliberately disrupting discussions
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Project-Specific Guidelines

In addition to the general standards above, we have specific expectations for the LibraVDB community:

### Technical Discussions

* **Be constructive**: Focus on the technical merits of ideas and implementations
* **Provide context**: When suggesting changes, explain the reasoning and benefits
* **Be patient**: Not everyone has the same level of experience with vector databases or Go
* **Share knowledge**: Help others learn and grow in the community
* **Acknowledge contributions**: Give credit where credit is due

### Code Reviews

* **Be respectful**: Critique code, not people
* **Be specific**: Provide clear, actionable feedback
* **Be educational**: Explain the "why" behind suggestions
* **Be collaborative**: Work together to find the best solutions
* **Be timely**: Respond to reviews in a reasonable timeframe

### Issue Reporting and Feature Requests

* **Be clear**: Provide detailed descriptions and reproduction steps
* **Be patient**: Maintainers are often volunteers with limited time
* **Be helpful**: Assist in troubleshooting and testing solutions
* **Be understanding**: Not all requests can be implemented immediately

### Community Participation

* **Welcome newcomers**: Help new contributors get started
* **Share experiences**: Contribute to discussions about use cases and best practices
* **Be inclusive**: Ensure everyone feels welcome to participate
* **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions relevant to LibraVDB and vector databases

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:

* GitHub repositories and all related spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki)
* Official communication channels (if any)
* Community events and meetups
* Social media interactions when representing the project
* Any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[conduct@libravdb.org] or by contacting project maintainers directly through GitHub.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
project community.

## Reporting Process

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by:

1. **GitHub**: Contact project maintainers directly through GitHub private messages
2. **Email**: Send a detailed report to [conduct@libravdb.org] (if available)
3. **Issue**: For less sensitive matters, you may create a private issue

When reporting, please include:

* Your contact information
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing
* The date and time of the incident
* Any additional information that may be helpful

### What to Expect

After filing a report, you can expect:

* **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
* **Investigation**: We will investigate the matter thoroughly and fairly
* **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress and any actions taken
* **Confidentiality**: We will respect your privacy and handle the matter discretely
* **No retaliation**: We will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports in good faith

## Appeals Process

If you disagree with an enforcement decision, you may appeal by:

1. Contacting the project maintainers with additional information
2. Requesting a review of the decision with clear reasoning
3. Providing new evidence or context that wasn't previously considered

Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers who were not involved in the original decision when possible.

### Foster Learning

* Share knowledge and expertise generously
* Ask questions and seek help when needed
