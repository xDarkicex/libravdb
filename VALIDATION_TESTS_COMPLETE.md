## 🔧 Issues Fixed During Implementation

### 1. HNSW Index Out of Bounds Issues
**Problem**: Panic in `connectBidirectional` and `pruneNeighborConnections` functions due to accessing neighbor node links at levels that don't exist.

**Solution**: Added bounds checking in both functions:
```go
// In connectBidirectional
if level < len(neighborNode.Links) {
    neighborNode.Links[level] = append(neighborNode.Links[level], nodeID)
}

// In pruneNeighborConnections  
if level >= len(neighborNode.Links) {
    continue
}
```

### 2. Validation Test Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Tests were using inconsistent dimensions and taking too long with large datasets.

**Solution**: 
- Standardized on dimension 4 for fast testing
- Reduced vector counts to reasonable sizes (100-1000 vectors)
- Optimized HNSW parameters for faster testing

### 3. Corruption Detection Issues
**Problem**: CRC corruption test was not detecting corruption because it was targeting the wrong offset.

**Solution**: 
- Analyzed the binary format structure in `format.go`
- Corrected CRC32 offset from 16 to 48 bytes (proper header layout)
- Enhanced corruption scenarios for better detection

### 4. Search Impact Test Dimension Mismatch
**Problem**: Query vector dimension (128) didn't match index dimension (4).

**Solution**: Fixed query vector creation to use the same dimension as the index.
