# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the core competitive capabilities needed to make LibraVDB competitive with production vector databases like Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, and Milvus. Phase 3 focuses on the highest ROI features: vector quantization for memory efficiency, advanced metadata filtering, batch operations for performance, multiple index types, and comprehensive memory management. These features will position LibraVDB as a viable alternative to existing vector database solutions while maintaining its simplicity as a Go library.

## Requirements

3. WHEN creating a collection with quantization THEN the system SHALL automatically train quantization parameters using a configurable ratio of training data
4. WHEN inserting vectors into a quantized collection THEN the system SHALL compress vectors according to the quantization configuration
5. WHEN searching in a quantized collection THEN the system SHALL maintain search accuracy within acceptable bounds while using compressed representations
6. WHEN quantization is enabled THEN the system SHALL reduce memory usage by at least 50% compared to full-precision vectors

### Requirement 2: Advanced Metadata Filtering

**User Story:** As a developer building applications with LibraVDB, I want sophisticated metadata filtering capabilities so that I can perform complex queries combining vector similarity with structured data constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building a query THEN the system SHALL support equality filters on string, numeric, and boolean metadata fields
2. WHEN building a query THEN the system SHALL support range filters (greater than, less than, between) on numeric and date fields
3. WHEN building a query THEN the system SHALL support array containment filters for multi-valued metadata fields
4. WHEN building a query THEN the system SHALL support combining multiple filters with AND/OR logic
5. WHEN executing filtered queries THEN the system SHALL apply metadata filters before vector similarity computation for performance
6. WHEN metadata filtering is used THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-100ms query latency for collections up to 1M vectors

### Requirement 3: Batch Operations

**User Story:** As a developer ingesting large amounts of data into LibraVDB, I want efficient batch operations so that I can achieve high throughput for bulk data operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing bulk inserts THEN the system SHALL support batch insertion of up to 10,000 vectors in a single operation
2. WHEN performing bulk updates THEN the system SHALL support batch updates of vector data and metadata
3. WHEN performing bulk deletes THEN the system SHALL support batch deletion by ID or metadata criteria
4. WHEN batch operations are used THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 10x throughput improvement over individual operations
5. WHEN batch operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for each failed item
6. WHEN batch operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain ACID properties and data consistency

### Requirement 4: Multiple Index Types

**User Story:** As a developer optimizing LibraVDB for different use cases, I want multiple index algorithms so that I can choose the best performance characteristics for my specific workload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a collection THEN the system SHALL support HNSW index configuration (existing)
2. WHEN creating a collection THEN the system SHALL support IVF-PQ (Inverted File with Product Quantization) index for large-scale scenarios
3. WHEN creating a collection THEN the system SHALL support Flat index for exact search and small collections
4. WHEN configuring IVF-PQ THEN the system SHALL allow specification of cluster count and probe parameters
5. WHEN using different index types THEN the system SHALL automatically select optimal search algorithms for each index type
6. WHEN switching index types THEN the system SHALL support index rebuilding without data loss

### Requirement 5: Memory Management and Limits

**User Story:** As a developer deploying LibraVDB in production, I want comprehensive memory management controls so that I can prevent out-of-memory conditions and optimize resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring LibraVDB THEN the system SHALL support setting global memory limits
2. WHEN memory usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL implement LRU cache eviction policies
3. WHEN configured THEN the system SHALL support memory mapping for large indices to reduce RAM usage
4. WHEN memory limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the condition without crashing
5. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide runtime memory usage statistics and controls
6. WHEN memory pressure occurs THEN the system SHALL trigger garbage collection and cache cleanup automatically

### Requirement 6: Performance Benchmarking

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating LibraVDB, I want comprehensive performance benchmarks so that I can compare it against other vector database solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running benchmarks THEN the system SHALL demonstrate competitive query latency compared to Pinecone, Qdrant, and Weaviate
2. WHEN running benchmarks THEN the system SHALL demonstrate competitive throughput for batch operations
3. WHEN running benchmarks THEN the system SHALL demonstrate memory efficiency improvements with quantization
4. WHEN running benchmarks THEN the system SHALL maintain accuracy metrics (recall@k) within 5% of full-precision results
5. WHEN benchmarking different index types THEN the system SHALL show appropriate performance characteristics for each use case
6. WHEN under load testing THEN the system SHALL maintain stable performance without memory leaks or degradation

### Requirement 7: API Compatibility and Ergonomics

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want intuitive and idiomatic APIs so that LibraVDB integrates seamlessly into my applications with minimal learning curve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the API THEN the system SHALL provide fluent query builder interfaces for complex operations
2. WHEN configuring collections THEN the system SHALL use functional options pattern for clean configuration
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed, actionable error messages
4. WHEN using batch operations THEN the system SHALL provide streaming interfaces for large datasets
5. WHEN integrating with applications THEN the system SHALL support context-based cancellation and timeouts
6. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing LibraVDB APIs
